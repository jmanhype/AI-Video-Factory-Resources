## Hook Frameworks (Copy & Adapt)

- "You're using CapCut wrong. Here's the feature you're ignoring"

**Works for:** Educational content, tool reviews, strategy breakdowns

- "This photo. In 30 seconds, watch it become a 3D animated video."
- "Zero AI experience. By the end of this video, you'll have a digital twin."

**Works for:** Real-time builds, transformations, walkthroughs

- "50 TikToks. 3 patterns. Here's the data."

**Works for:** Research-based content, comparisons, data insights

### 10. The Secret/Hidden Pattern
**Structure:** "Here's [something] no one talks about"

**Examples:**
- "The CapCut setting no one uses that makes videos look pro"
