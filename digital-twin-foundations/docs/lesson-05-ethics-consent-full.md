**Course:** Digital Twin Foundations
**Lesson Type:** Ethics & Compliance
**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Outcome:** Understand consent requirements and ethical boundaries for digital twin content

## Hook: The $7M Lawsuit You Can Avoid

In 2024, a content creator lost a $7 million lawsuit for using someone's likeness without consent in AI-generated content. The court ruled that digital twins, even when created from publicly available images, require explicit permission.

**This lesson shows you how to stay legally compliant and ethically sound.**

---

## Why Ethics Matter (Beyond Legal Risk)

Digital twin technology creates realistic representations of real people. Without proper consent:

- **Legal exposure**: Likeness rights lawsuits (varies by state)
- **Platform bans**: TikTok, YouTube, Instagram all ban unauthorized deepfakes
- **Reputation damage**: Your brand becomes known for exploitation, not innovation
- **Loss of trust**: Audiences reject creators who don't respect consent

**The AI Video Factory Promise:** We build with consent. Period.

## The 3-Layer Consent Framework

### Layer 1: Legal Consent (The Minimum)

**What you need:**
- Written permission to use someone's likeness
- Clear scope of usage (commercial vs personal)
- Time-bound agreement (1 year, perpetual, etc.)
- Right to revoke consent

**Template provided:** `consent-agreement-template.pdf` (in this folder)

### Layer 2: Informed Consent (The Standard)

The person must understand:
- How their likeness will be used
- What AI tools will process their data
- Where the content will be published
- How to request removal

**Example disclosure:**
> "I will create a digital twin of your face using HeyGen AI. This will generate a 30-second video of you speaking my script. I'll post it on LinkedIn and TikTok. You can request removal anytime."

### Layer 3: Ongoing Consent (The Rebel + Lover Standard)

Even after legal consent:
- **Check in before major uses**: "Hey, I'm making a course. Can I use your twin as an example?"
- **Share drafts**: Let them see the content before it goes live
- **Honor takedown requests immediately**: No questions, no delays
- **Credit properly**: Tag them, link to their work, respect their brand

**This is the AI Video Factory standard.** We go beyond compliance to respect.

## Red Flags: When NOT to Create a Digital Twin

❌ **Never create digital twins of:**
- Public figures without explicit permission (yes, even if they're "famous")
- Minors under 18 (even with parent consent - platforms ban this)
- People who've explicitly said no
- Deceased individuals without estate permission
- Competitors for misleading purposes

❌ **Never use digital twins to:**
- Endorse products the person doesn't use
- Make political statements they don't hold
- Create adult content (always banned)
- Impersonate for fraud or scams

**Even if legal, these violate platform ToS and ethical standards.**

## Platform-Specific Rules (2025)

### YouTube
- Requires consent disclosure in video description
- Bans misleading deepfakes (political, financial)
- Allows parody/satire with clear labeling

### TikTok
- Zero tolerance for non-consensual deepfakes
- Requires #AIGenerated tag
- Bans minor deepfakes even with consent

### Instagram/Facebook
- Requires consent + AI disclosure
- Bans impersonation
- Allows creator's own likeness freely

### LinkedIn
- Business use requires professional consent
- Endorsements need explicit permission
- Educational use (courses, demos) with disclosure is allowed

**Rule of thumb:** When in doubt, disclose and get permission.

**Minimum fields:**
- Full name and signature

### Step 3: Create Responsibly
- Use only the footage they approved

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before creating ANY digital twin:

- [ ] Do I have written consent?
