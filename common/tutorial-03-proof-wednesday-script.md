## Avatar Script (What Your Digital Twin Will Say)

### [0:00-0:30] HOOK (30 seconds)

"Every Wednesday, AI Video Factory members post proof. Not promises. Not plans. Proof.

Before/after. Prompt. Lesson learned.

That's it. Three things. No fluff.

Here's exactly what to post and why each part matters."

---

### [0:30-2:00] PART 1: BEFORE/AFTER (90 seconds)

"First element: before and after. Show the transformation.

Before can be:
- Blank timeline screenshot
- Empty document
- Stock footage URL
- Anything that shows 'not done yet'

After must be:
- Final video posted to platform
- Screenshot with view count
- Link to live content
- Proof it's real and shipped

Bad before/after: random screenshots with no context.
Good before/after: clear transformation, ten minutes or less.

The before/after proves you didn't just talk about it. You built it."

**[Screen recording shows: Skool post with good vs bad before/after examples]**

---

### [2:00-4:00] PART 2: YOUR PROMPT (2 minutes)

"Second element: your prompt. Copy-paste exactly what you used.

Not a summary. Not 'I used Pexels.' The EXACT search term, voice settings, export config.

Good prompt format:
'Stock search: morning coffee
ElevenLabs: Rachel voice, 50% stability, 75% clarity
Script: Start your morning right with the perfect brew
CapCut export: 1080x1920, 30fps, high quality'

Why this matters: other members can replicate your result. That's the point. We're not gatekeeping. We're demonstrating.

If someone can't copy-paste your prompt and get the same outcome, you didn't share enough."

**[Screen recording shows: Comment section with properly formatted prompt vs vague description]**

---

### [4:00-6:00] PART 3: LESSON LEARNED (2 minutes)

"Third element: one lesson you learned.

Not what went right. What you'd do differently next time.

Bad lesson: 'This was great!'
Good lesson: 'Spent three minutes searching for perfect clip. Next time I'll use first good option and move on.'

Another good one: 'Exported wrong aspect ratio first. Always double-check nine-sixteen before posting.'

The lesson teaches others what to avoid. It also proves you're iterating, not just flexing.

Proof Wednesday isn't a highlight reel. It's a build log."

**[Screen recording shows: Comment replies where members apply someone else's lesson]**

---

### [6:00-7:30] WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU POST (90 seconds)

"After you post, two things happen.

One: You reply to at least one other post with a concrete tip. Not 'great job.' Not 'love this.'

Concrete tip: 'Try Rachel voice instead of Bella for product demos. Clearer pronunciation.'

Or: 'Your hook is buried at second five. Move it to frame one.'

Two: You check back twenty-four hours later. Screenshot your analytics. Note what worked. Post that in comments.

This loop—build, post proof, give feedback, track results—is how you improve faster than solo creators."

**[Screen recording shows: Proof Wednesday thread with replies showing concrete tips]**

---

### [7:30-8:00] YOUR TURN (30 seconds)

"Next Wednesday, post yours.

Before/after. Prompt. Lesson.

If you haven't built anything yet, build something today. Stock clip to short. Digital twin test. Anything.

Ship it. Post proof Wednesday. Get feedback.

That's the format."

**Why this is bad:**
- No before/after
- No prompt (can't replicate)
- No lesson learned
- Just promotion, not proof
- Asking for validation, not sharing insights

---

## Community Guidelines (Mention in Tutorial)

### Moderators Will Remove:
- Posts with no before/after
- Links with no context or prompts
- Self-promotion without proof
- "Coming soon" or "sneak peek" posts
- Asking for likes/comments without value

### What Gets Pinned:
- Exceptionally clear before/after

- Honest lessons (especially failures)
- Posts that generate concrete feedback threads
