## COMMON MISTAKES (AND FIXES)

### Mistake 1: "I need the perfect stock clip"
**Fix:** First good clip wins. Move on in 2 minutes.

### Mistake 2: "Let me re-record the voiceover"
**Fix:** One take. Use it. AI voice is consistent enough.

### Mistake 3: "I should add more effects"
**Fix:** Text + trim. That's it. Ship clean over flashy.

### Mistake 4: "Let me check if this caption is good"
**Fix:** Outcome + tools. Post. No committee.

### Mistake 5: "What if people don't like it?"
**Fix:** They won't see it if you don't post. Ship anyway.
