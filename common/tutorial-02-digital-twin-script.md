## Avatar Script (What Your Digital Twin Will Say)

### [0:00-0:30] HOOK (30 seconds)

"You're about to watch me create a digital twin of myself. No fancy equipment. No studio. Just one photo and fifteen minutes.

By the end of this, I'll have an avatar that can narrate any tutorial I write. Let's build it."

---

### [0:30-2:00] STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR PHOTO (90 seconds)

"First, you need one good photo. Forward-facing. Eye level. Good lighting.

I'm using this one. Taken with my phone. Natural window light. Plain background. No filters.

Save it to your desktop. Name it 'avatar-source.jpg'. Keep it simple."

**[Screen recording shows: Photo file on desktop, properties panel showing resolution]**

---

### [2:00-5:00] STEP 2: UPLOAD TO CAPCUT (3 minutes)

"Open CapCut desktop. Click AI Tools. Find 'AI Avatar' or 'Digital Human.'

Click 'Create Custom Avatar.' Upload your photo.

CapCut analyzes it. Two to five minutes. Watch the progress bar. Don't click away or it cancels.

While we wait: this works because CapCut maps your facial features to a 3D model. It tracks eyes, mouth, jawline. Then it animates those points to match any audio you give it.

Done. My avatar is ready."

**[Screen recording shows: CapCut interface, AI Tools menu, upload process, progress bar, completion notification]**

---

### [5:00-8:00] STEP 3: TEST WITH A SCRIPT (3 minutes)

"Now the test. Paste this script: 'Welcome to AI Video Factory. This is my digital twin speaking.'

Select a voice. I'm using my cloned voice. But you can use any stock voice that matches your vibe.

Hit generate. Thirty seconds later, there I am. Speaking words I never recorded.

Watch the lip-sync. It's not perfect, but it's good enough for tutorials. The goal isn't perfection. The goal is shipping."

**[Screen recording shows: Script paste, voice selection, generate button, preview playback]**

---

### [8:00-12:00] STEP 4: EXPORT AND SAVE (4 minutes)

"Click export. Settings: nineteen-twenty by ten-eighty. MP4 format. High quality.

Save it to your videos folder. Name it 'avatar-test-01.mp4'.

Now the real power: I can paste ANY script and this avatar narrates it. Tutorial scripts. Course intros. Proof Wednesday posts.

I record my screen doing the work. Write what I'd say. Avatar speaks it. I overlay the two. Done.

No more recording myself explaining things. I just build and write."

**[Screen recording shows: Export settings panel, save dialog, final file in finder]**

---

### [12:00-15:00] STEP 5: YOUR FIRST USE CASE (3 minutes)

"Here's how I'll use this. Next tutorial: 'Stock Clip to Branded Short in Ten Minutes.'

I'll screen record myself building it. No audio. Just actions.

Then I'll write the script. What I'd say if I was narrating live.

Paste that script here. Avatar speaks it. Download the video.

Import both into CapCut. Overlay avatar in the corner. Sync timing. Export.

One tutorial, ten minutes total. No re-recording if I mess up the build. No 'um' filler words. Just clean narration.

That's the promise: from blank to posted in one sitting."

### [15:00] CLOSE

"That's it. Fifteen minutes. You now have a digital twin.

Post your first avatar test in AI Video Factory. Tag it 'digital twin proof.' Show us what you built.

Ship anyway."
