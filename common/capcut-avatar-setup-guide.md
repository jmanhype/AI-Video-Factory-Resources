## Best Practices for Tutorial Narration

### Script Writing
- [ ] Write conversationally (how you'd actually explain it)
- [ ] Use short sentences (15-20 words max)
- [ ] Add pauses with periods or commas
- [ ] Avoid jargon unless explaining it
- [ ] Reference what's on screen: "See this clip?" "Click download."

### Voice Selection
- [ ] Match voice energy to content (professional = calm, casual = energetic)
- [ ] Test 2-3 voices before committing
- [ ] Keep same voice across all tutorials (brand consistency)

### Avatar Positioning
- [ ] Bottom-right corner for demos (doesn't obscure action)
- [ ] Left side for intros/outros (more prominent)
- [ ] Never cover critical UI elements
- [ ] Keep avatar size 15-25% of screen

### Timing
- [ ] Sync avatar speech with screen actions
- [ ] Pause avatar during silent screen work (cut narration, show pure demo)
- [ ] Resume narration to explain next step
