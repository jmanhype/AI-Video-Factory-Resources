## Avatar Script (What Your Digital Twin Will Say)

### [0:00-0:30] HOOK (30 seconds)

"You're looking at a blank CapCut timeline. In exactly 10 minutes, this becomes a posted TikTok short. No fluff. No 'welcome back.' Just the build. Here's every step."

---

### [0:30-2:00] STEP 1: STOCK FOOTAGE (90 seconds)

"First, open Pexels dot com. Search 'morning coffee.' Not just 'coffee'—be specific. Filter by HD and free to use.

See this clip? Morning light, steam rising. That's the one. Click download. Five seconds of footage, that's all we need.

Don't spend more than two minutes searching. First good clip wins. Perfection is the enemy here. Move on."

**[Screen recording shows: Pexels search, filter selection, download click]**

---

### [2:00-4:00] STEP 2: VOICEOVER (2 minutes)

"Now open ElevenLabs. Paste this exact script: 'Start your morning right with the perfect brew.'

That's it. Fifteen words. Select Rachel voice. Stability fifty percent, clarity seventy-five percent. Hit generate.

Three seconds later, you've got professional voiceover. Download the MP3. No recording booth. No retakes. Done."

**[Screen recording shows: ElevenLabs interface, script paste, voice selection, generate, download]**

### [4:00-8:00] STEP 3: EDIT IN CAPCUT (4 minutes)

"Import both files into CapCut. Stock clip on timeline. Voiceover below it.

Trim the stock to match audio length. Fifteen seconds total. Add text overlay: brand name, centered, white with black stroke. Montserrat Bold, size ninety.

Now the secret: export settings. Resolution ten-eighty by nineteen-twenty. That's nine-sixteen vertical. Frame rate thirty FPS. Format MP4. Quality set to high.

Hit export. File size under fifty megabytes. Perfect for TikTok, Reels, Shorts."

**[Screen recording shows: Import, timeline arrangement, text overlay, export settings panel]**

### [8:00-10:00] STEP 4: POST IT (2 minutes)

"Upload to TikTok from your phone. Caption: 'Built in ten minutes. Prompt in comments.'

Add three hashtags. AI Video. Content Creation. No more than five total.

Post. No reviewing. No committee. No second-guessing.

Ten minutes. Blank to posted. That's the promise."

**[Screen recording shows: Phone upload screen, caption typing, hashtag selection, post button]**

### [10:00] CLOSE

"That's it. Now post YOUR version in AI Video Factory Proof Wednesday thread. Drop the link. One concrete tip for someone else.

Ship anyway."
